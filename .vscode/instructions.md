# Facebook OSINT Tool Development Plan

## Project Overview
This document outlines the development plan for a Facebook OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tool designed to analyze public Facebook profiles starting from a "seed" profile, map relationships, and identify potential risk factors. The tool will support recursive search up to 5 levels deep and cross-platform functionality.
